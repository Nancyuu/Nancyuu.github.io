									<p>Hi! My name is Ruining Yang, and I prefer to go by Nancy. As a graduating senior from Mount Holyoke College, I hold a double major in Data Science and International Relations, and I am thrilled to be pursuing a master's degree in Data Science.
										Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have been privileged to explore a diverse range of topics, ranging from statistical modeling and machine learning to international politics and diplomacy.
										I look forward to bringing this interdisciplinary perspective to my future work in data science.
										In addition to my coursework, I have gained valuable practical experience through various projects and internships. These experiences have taught me critical skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.
										Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy engaging in various hobbies such as reading, hiking, and playing badminton, which help me stay creative and well-rounded.
									<p>My personal website offers a glimpse into my academic experiences, ongoing and completed projects, professional skills, updates, and even a mysterious box about me! The Home page offers detailed information on each section.</p>
									<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am eager to continue learning and growing in the field of data science, and I look forward to the opportunity to pursue my career in this exciting and dynamic field. If you have any questions about me or are interested in my ongoing or completed projects, please feel free to reach out to me!</p>
